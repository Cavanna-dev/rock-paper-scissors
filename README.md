Ways to improve
--------------

- Security: If we change the data stored in the buttons (rock for example). We send data two times. One time with correct data, and the second time with the wrong data.
We check if data is correct but still.

- Tests: sorry guys, I respected the 5 hours scope and can't find anymore time to do more or even test things. I find it more reliable for you to see what I can do in 5 hours than go through 10 hours project full of what I want to do. So yeah, it misses unit tests to be good for me :)

- Front: since I'm really a back guy, I don't find usefull to take time on front things. I tried my best, it's horrible. But I least you can play.

- Since I couldn't use any external libs, I did my best with javascript vanilla and php 7.3. But I'm still pretty proud of the design I used. I can add Lizard / Spock in a very short amount of time. But I'm really ashame about how I used my constants. Like use Game::ROCK to define what is a rock? So bad, really bad. My class Rock should handle itself how it's named.

- Validator. It is okay but maybe I should have used a form to do the workflow. I never used xhttp this way, and it was a good occasion to improve myself

- The result of the game. I'm so bad at this. I mean, everything was clear in my head, until I reach this point and don't know how to deal with this. So sorry about this part, it's the worse for me.

Thanks for reading and taking time for me btw.
